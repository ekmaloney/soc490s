    "text": "Name\nEmail\nOffice\nDrop-in Hours\n\n\n\n\nProf. Lynn Smith-Lovin (she/her)\nsmithlov@duke.edu\nReuben-Cooke 339\nschedule by email\n\n\nEm Maloney (they/them)\nem.k.maloney@duke.edu\nReuben-Cooke 141\nThursdays 1-2pm or schedule by email\n\n\n\n\nCourse Description\nThis course is a senior research seminar using a sociological lens to explore the relationship between occupations and social status. We will begin by returning to classical sociological theory to understand precisely what status is and what role occupations serve in the context of society and social interaction. Next, we will review the debate surrounding measuring occupational status and how operationalizing it precisely has important consequences for downstream social research. Finally, we will read and evaluate research showing how status is linked to demographic characteristics of occupations, how status ‘plays out’ on the job, and mechanisms by which occupational status is maintained through institutions.\nIn exploring these questions, we will privilege one sociological theory: affect control theory, as a way of measuring culture broadly and occupational status in particular. This theory is a formal model of social interaction with tools for running simulations and developing testable hypotheses that will guide your original research throughout the semester. As this is a capstone course, the major portion of your grade for this class will be an original research project on a question related to occupational status that you will complete throughout the course. Throughout the semester, assignments will lead you throughout the research project, allowing you to get feedback from instructors and your peers as you refine your research question and decide on appropriate methods, complete your literature review, conduct your analyses, and finally, write the full draft of the paper.\nTo serve both of these aims: a thorough understanding of the current landscape of sociological work on occupations and status and the generation of an original research project, this course will generally have a split Wednesday / Friday structure. On Wednesdays, we will follow a typical course format with lectures and class activities linked to readings you will read before class. Fridays will often be more of a lab style. In the first half of the semester, Fridays will be devoted to learning affect control theory and its simulation tools. During this portion, approximately every other week you will be assigned a short lab assignment to help you become familiar with the theory. In the second half, Fridays will be for working through the assignments that are linked to your final research paper and getting feedback on your work.\n\n\nCourse Objectives\nBy the end of this course, you will be able to:\n\nAssess different methods of measuring occupational status and tie them to relevant social theorists’ paradigms\nDesign a research project on a topic related to occupations and status\nUnderstand the basic tenets of Affect Control Theory and apply them to substantive, original research on occupations\nDemonstrate how being in differently valued occupations affects individuals’ material, social, and emotional outcomes.\nInterpret evidence for and against current debates in the sociology of work and status, including the gender devaluation hypothesis.\n\n\n\nCourse Grading\n\nClass participation (15%)\nLabs (15%)\n\nThere are 3 labs, each equal to 5% of your grade\n\nAssignments (20%)\n\nResearch Question (5%)\nAnnotated Bibliography (5%)\nLiterature Review (5%)\nMethods Plan (5%)\n\nFinal Research Paper (40%)\n\n\n\nAttendance Policy\nAttendance in this class is mandatory (conditional on you being well enough to attend - please do not come to class if you are sick!). Unexcused absences will decrease your participation grade in the course.\n\n\nTechnology\nWe will be doing online activities and labs throughout the class; please bring your laptops or tablets to class days, especially Fridays. The course website can be found here: https://ekmaloney.github.io/soc490s/ and is where you can find all course materials, including readings, labs, and assignments.\n\n\nCourse communication\nIf you have any questions about the course material, lectures, or missing class, please email Em at em.k.maloney@duke.edu. If you have any questions about grading, please email Professor Smith-Lovin at smithlov@duke.edu\n\n\nStudent Success\nIf you are having trouble completing assignments or understanding the materials, please consult with us about appropriate course preparation and readiness strategies as needed. Either send us an email or visit office hours describing the personal or academic difficulties you are facing. We may also direct you to other resources on campus.\n\nThe Academic Resource Center (ARC) offers free services to all students, including peer tutoring, learning consultations, ADHD/LD coaching and help with online learning.\nIf you are concerned about your physical or mental health, DukeReach can connect you with departments across campus to get you help, and you can contact Counseling & Psychological Services (CAPS) directly for counseling services. You can also reach 24/7 mental health support through Blue Devils Care.\n\n\n\nAcademic Accommodations\nIf you need to request accommodation for a disability, you should contact the Disability Management System (DMS) office. We will work with that office to provide you with equal access to course materials and make accommodations.\n\n\nAcademic Integrity\nAs a student, you should abide by Duke’s Community Standard, which states: Duke University is a community dedicated to scholarship, leadership, and service and to the principles of honesty, fairness, respect and accountability. Citizens of this community commit to reflect upon and uphold these principles in all academic and nonacademic endeavors, and to protect and promote a culture of integrity. To uphold the Duke Community Standard:\n\nI will not lie, cheat, or steal in my academic endeavors.\nI will conduct myself honorably in all my endeavors; and\nI will act if the Standard is compromised.\n\nIt is the responsibility of the student to understand and follow Duke policies regarding academic integrity, including doing one’s own work, following proper citations of sources, and adhering to guidance around group work. Please speak with me to get any clarification about this course."
