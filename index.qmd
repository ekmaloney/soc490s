### Course Description

This course is a senior research seminar using a sociological lens to explore the relationship between occupations and social status. We will begin by returning to classical sociological theory to understand precisely what status is and what role occupations serve in the context of society and social interaction. Next, we will review the debate surrounding measuring occupational status and how operationalizing it precisely has important consequences for downstream social research. Finally, we will read and evaluate research showing how status is linked to demographic characteristics of occupations, how status 'plays out' on the job, and mechanisms by which occupational status is maintained through institutions.

In exploring these questions, we will privilege one sociological theory: affect control theory, as a way of measuring culture broadly and occupational status in particular. This theory is a formal model of social interaction with tools for running simulations and developing testable hypotheses that will guide your original research throughout the semester. As this is a capstone course, the major portion of your grade for this class will be an original research project on a question related to occupational status that you will complete throughout the course. Throughout the semester, assignments will lead you throughout the research project, allowing you to get feedback from instructors and your peers as you refine your research question and decide on appropriate methods, complete your literature review, conduct your analyses, and finally, write the full draft of the paper.

To serve both of these aims: a thorough understanding of the current landscape of sociological work on occupations and status and the generation of an original research project, this course will generally have a split Wednesday / Friday structure. On Wednesdays, we will follow a typical course format, with lectures and class activities linked to readings you will prepare for class. Fridays will often be more of a lab style. In the first half of the semester, Fridays will be devoted to learning affect control theory and its simulation tools. During this portion, approximately each week you will be assigned a short lab assignment to help you become familiar with the theory. In the second half, Fridays will be for working through the assignments that are linked to your final research paper.

As such, your grade will consist of four parts:

1.  Class participation (15%)

2.  Labs (15%)

3.  Assignments (20%)

4.  Final Research Paper (40%)
